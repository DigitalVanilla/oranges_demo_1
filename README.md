Demo#1 by "Oranges" Demogroup, MMXXV

Some extra notes:
. There is a bug at the end of demo where the grid of cubes is having a z-buffer tantrum render, this will be fixed in future releases of Sage
. Compiling the demo should be fairly easy, just install SASC6.5 or above in your beloved Amiga Vampire and use the makefile
. Codecraft was used to write and compile the demo, you can also use this IDE to build, play and run
. This demo will be improved in the future with more stuff added on it, like a showcase for the Apollo Amiga Vampire
. Play, modify, change, have fun...
. Code is not optimized and messy, t'was my first experience in C, but It was a nice adventure ^_^
